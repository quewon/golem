GOLEM OF HER GALLERY

“you are my masterpiece.”

you are a robot, and your creator has passed away leaving her only possession, her home and art gallery, to you
you grow and develop robots that create art
you host an art gallery where you put up the works of these robots

you enter the mindscape of bots in order to breed complexity
and to get a better idea of what they want the piece to be titled
in these dreams you’ll find environments and creatures bursting with life and complexity

you fix robots that get overworked or bugged
you fix the robots that get donated to you
you repurpose parts to create a new robot


a home for trashed robots
sometimes people come to you and ask you to fix their bot for parts or trinkets


living up to your creator’s expectations of you
you’ll never be human, it’s a failing battle
maybe you should try to be robot
trying to figure out what it means to be a robot
to be crafted, designed, yet so open to change


you start out by copying what your creator did, pretending to be your creator, going through with the tasks that he left you
and then your goals change when people realize your creator’s dead. you try to act robotic in the way humans expect
	the robot-human relationship is one like in Her
but as you find more and more complexity in these robots you raise,
	and you meet ther kid that tells you that you’ll never be human
	you start to try to figure out what it means to be robot

your creator wanted to be immortal, and so created you
and you’re immortal, but now your goals are different from her
is it ok to change?
“change is in the nature of technology. you are a robot.”
