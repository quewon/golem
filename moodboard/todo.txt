### to do

[x] variable scene sizes
[x] camera
[x] collision mapping

[x] platformer physics
    [x] collision
    [x] gravity
    [x] jumping

    objects & npcs : you can only collide with them from the top

[ ] items
    [ ] paintings, which are placed on walls and don't collide
    [ ] modules that can be attached to bots
    [x] misc items
[x] picking stuff up, placing things down, jumping on them
    [x] stacking objects on your head

    no menus -- everything ingame
    all ui is diegetic
    open world

[ ] scenes
    [ ] the art gallery
    [ ] robot junkyard
    [ ] the graveyard
[ ] doors
    
    graveyard is where you spawn, having just buried your creator
    with the to-do list she left logged in your system:
        - bury my body under the mango tree
        - train the bots to generate art of their own
        - keep the gallery going
        - i trust you'll have no problem with my death
        for you are my masterpiece
    the protocol has been triggered with her death

[ ] robots made of modules
    [ ] body (mandatory)
    [ ] cpu (m)
    [ ] sensors
    [ ] manipulators
        [ ] grabby hands
        [ ] speakers
        [ ] screen
    [ ] battery (m)
    [ ] drivetrain
        [ ] wheels
        [ ] legs

    [ ] tiny robot mindscape that generates and grows depending on their personality and OS data

    you can connect up to this robot's cpu to access its sensory information and mindscape

        [ ] the more you interact with their mindscape... the more potential they develop?
        [ ] mindscapes have their own ecosystems

    [ ] fixing robots by putting modules together
    [ ] battery system -- charging dead robots
    [ ] cpus that have to be reset, perhaps connecting them to your own cpu to copy the OS

    [ ] robots don't have voices, but emote in their own way ?

[ ] npcs
    [ ] randos asking you to fix their bot for modules
    [ ] random gallery visitors that wonder why there isn't any new art
    [ ] your creator's old friends and fans

[ ] day system where the junkyard and gallery refreshes every day
    [ ] day-specific npc events
    [ ] the gallery updates its works every season



### qof

[x] keypress happens on update interval, so the first press and the second press have uneven intervals

    the fix : just use an update loop for all of them

[x] when you jump the guys dont follow you
[x] placing should happen on a timer
[ ] you should be able to walk up one pixel stairs
[ ] sort objects that you can pick up by distance to player
    [ ] same y level is prioritized
    [ ] then same x level
[x] objects you're carrying should collide and stop you from moving
[ ] the more things on your head, the weightier you become?
[x] you can turn physicsupdates off for items on your head
[x] if you ever get around fixing the transparency issue
    [x] then also fix the fact that player collides with transparent parts of robots
        i think you can get around this by comparing the topmost and bottommost rows of edge pixels
[x] why are we grounded when we're touching the ceiling?

[ ] things on head fall through sometimes ? why
[ ] fall sound doesn't play when you fall off something instead of jumping of of it

### story

you grow and develop robots that create art
you host an art gallery where you put up the works of these robots

living up to your creator’s expectations of you
you’ll never be human, it’s a failing battle
maybe you should try to be robot
trying to figure out what it means to be a robot
to be crafted, designed, yet so open to change


you start out by copying what your creator did, pretending to be your creator, going through with the tasks that she left you
and then your goals change when people realize your creator’s dead. you try to act robotic in the way humans expect
  the robot-human relationship is one like in Her
but as you find more and more complexity in these robots you raise,
  and you meet ther kid that tells you that you’ll never be human
  you start to try to figure out what it means to be robot

your creator wanted to be immortal, and so created you
and you’re immortal, but now your goals are different from her
is it ok to change?
“change is in the nature of technology. you are a robot.”
